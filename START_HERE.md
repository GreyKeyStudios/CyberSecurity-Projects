## 📖 IMPORTANT: How to Talk About This

**Read this FIRST:** `HOW_TO_TALK_ABOUT_THIS.md`

### The One-Liner for Resume/LinkedIn:
> "Built and maintain a personal SOC Operating System: a curated portfolio + learning environment that organizes my Splunk queries, incident response templates, IOC investigation workflows, code examples, and interview prep resources. Developed using AI-assisted workflows and refined through hands-on testing and continuous iteration."

### If Asked "Did you build all this?"
> "Not line-by-line manually. I used AI tools to accelerate scaffolding and content generation, but I designed the structure, validated the outputs, tested the tools, and I actively use the system to practice SOC workflows."

**Be honest. It's more impressive.**

## 💡 Key Changes You'll See

### Website Tone
**Old:** "SOC Learning Hub - comprehensive collection for aspiring analysts"
**New:** "My SOC Operating System - tools I use daily"

### Sections Now Say:
- "Templates I use when investigating"

---

## 🎯 The Point

**This isn't a portfolio.**
**It's your personal SOC wiki.**

You update it as you learn.
You use it every day.
It's real, not polished.

And that's exactly what makes it impressive.

## 📈 Keep It Updated

**Update when:**
- ✅ You learn a new tool → Add to tools list
- ✅ You create a template → Add to Templates/
- ✅ You write a script → Add to Code-Examples/
- ✅ You complete a lab → Add casefile
- ✅ You practice daily → Update checklist

**The rule:**
If you're not using it, delete it.
If you use it daily, keep it.

## 🎓 Remember

### This Works Because:
1. **You built it for YOU** (not for show)
2. **You actually USE it** (not just display it)
3. **It's real** (not perfect)
4. **It evolves** (not frozen)

### It Shows:
- Self-directed learning
- Professional documentation habits
- Real daily workflows
- Engineering mindset
- Continuous improvement

### Employers See:
"This person doesn't just learn SOC work — they built a system to get better at it every day."

**That's exactly who they want to hire.**
