# SOC / Cybersecurity Portfolio — Michael Walton

**Michael Walton** | Information Technology Professional with 9+ years experience (10 years in March 2026)

This repository contains hands-on cybersecurity labs and SOC-style investigation writeups demonstrating:
- Alert triage & documentation
- Log analysis (Windows / network / firewall)
- IDS concepts & tuning
- Phishing analysis
- Threat intelligence workflows
- Network forensics
- Malware analysis

## 🛠️ SOC Operating System

I've organized this into a **personal SOC Operating System** — a curated learning environment with investigation templates, IOC workflows, Splunk queries, cheat sheets, and interview prep resources. Developed using AI-assisted workflows and refined through hands-on testing.

**📖 Important:** See `HOW_TO_TALK_ABOUT_THIS.md` for interview-safe language when describing this project.

## ⭐ Best Work (Start Here)

## 📋 SOC Casefiles (Most Relevant to SOC Analyst I)

These casefiles demonstrate real-world SOC investigation workflows:

- **[001 - Phishing Triage](SOC-Casefiles/001-Phishing-Triage/)** — Email header analysis, IOC extraction, verdict, containment
- **[002 - Brute Force Login](SOC-Casefiles/002-Brute-Force-Login/)** — Authentication log analysis, IP intel, conclusion
- **[003 - Malware/EDR Alert](SOC-Casefiles/003-Malware-EDR-Alert/)** — Artifact review, scope assessment, escalation notes
- **[004 - Impossible Travel](SOC-Casefiles/004-Impossible-Travel/)** — Identity event triage & recommendations
- **[005 - Splunk Failed Login Triage ⭐](SOC-Casefiles/005-Splunk-Failed-Login-Triage/)** — **Real evidence** - Uses actual Splunk dashboard and queries from Log-Analysis project

Each casefile includes: alert summary, investigation steps, findings, resolution, and ticket notes.
